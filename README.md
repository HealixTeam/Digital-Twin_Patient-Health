Intelligent Digital Twin System for Patient Health Monitoring and Early Risk Prediction
1️⃣ What is the problem / Market Pain you see?
The healthcare industry faces significant challenges in continuous patient monitoring and early detection of health risks. Many critical health events are detected too late due to manual monitoring, fragmented data from multiple sources, and limited predictive tools. Physicians and caregivers often struggle to interpret complex patient data in real-time, leading to delayed interventions and higher treatment costs. There is a growing need for real-time, patient-specific monitoring solutions that are reliable, scalable, and explainable.

2️⃣ Brief description about your solution
Our solution is an AI-powered Digital Twin platform that creates a virtual representation of each patient, continuously integrating data from wearable devices and electronic health records. The system predicts potential health risks before they become critical, provides personalized alerts, and uses Explainable AI (SHAP) to help doctors understand the factors driving the predictions. The platform also includes a dashboard for real-time monitoring, visualization of health metrics, and risk trends, enabling proactive and data-driven healthcare decisions.

3️⃣ How do you make money from your project?
The project can generate revenue through multiple channels:

Subscription-based model: Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers pay a recurring fee per patient or per institution for access to the platform.

Licensing: Offer the platform as a licensed software solution for integration with existing hospital IT systems.

Premium Analytics & Insights: Advanced predictive analytics, reporting, and personalized patient risk insights can be offered as premium add-ons.

Data Partnership (Optional & Privacy-compliant): Aggregated and anonymized data insights could be licensed to research institutions or pharmaceutical companies for improving healthcare solutions.
